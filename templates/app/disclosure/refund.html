                <strong>Parcel Opening Video Requirement:</strong> For all damage claims and return considerations, we kindly request customers to record a video while opening the parcel. This video is crucial for substantiating damage claims and ensuring a swift resolution.

                <strong>Handwoven Saree Characteristics:</strong> Given the handwoven nature of our sarees, it's important to note that extra threads, handloom marks, thread pullings, and jumpings are inherent characteristics and are not considered as damages. These elements contribute to the unique charm and authenticity of each saree.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Damages and Reporting:</strong> Returns will be accepted only for damages to the sarees. It is imperative to report any damages within one day of receiving the product. The damage should be clearly recorded in the parcel opening video without any cuts for a valid claim.

                <strong>Saree Folding Requirements:</strong> Sarees being returned must be properly folded. Any misfolds may result in the saree being returned to the customer. Proper folding ensures the protection and integrity of the product during transit.

            <li>
                <strong>Exchange Process:</strong> The exchange of the saree will be initiated after we receive the returned item in good condition, adhering to the guidelines mentioned above.
